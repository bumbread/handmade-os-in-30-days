## Preface

"I want to make an OS". Every programmer has had friends that had this dream. Well, "every" is probably an overstatement, but this phrase most likely hits the top 10 programmer's dreams.

You probably think that creating an OS is a tremendous task, but that's just the OS industry's conspiracy (lol). If one believes the OS are difficult to make, they can sell it under a higher price tag, also the creators of the OS get respected, etc. ...but what about the reality? Compared to other programs, OS's are not that hard to make. At the very least the writer of this book thinks so.

Among the readers there may probably people who tried to make an OS once, and gave up because it was too difficult. People like this probably won't find this explanation to be very convincing. ...no, no, it didn't fail because it was difficult, it's just that there was no one to explain that it was easy.

It doesn't apply only to creation of OS. Even if you get an explanation from a person who thinks about it as a hard thing, you can't expect a nice easy-to-understand explanation. Even if you make them explain the same thing, they should give difficult and complicated explanation. It naturally becomes hard to understand.

Come on, would you go onto a challenge together with the author? If you ever thought about making an OS once, you'll probably enjoy it.

You probably think "where's the 'easy' and 'fun' that you're talking about, on this 700 page book?". I understand its not very convincing when it's said, but it simply got longer. On average it's 22 pages per day. See? It's not that long.

Since the text is too light it's possible that you will read it too swiftly. But if you do that it won't stay in your head, so try chewing through the text slowly. Since the code is as important as the explanation, read through the code carefully as well. If you're aware of this, you should understand the text enough.

In this book the OS is written using the C language and an assembly language. But don't worry. You can study these while making an OS. I'm writing carefully. To a degree, where there are people who say things like "I started understanding pointers in C for the first time after reading this book!". So even if you start from this point, you'll still make a nice OS in 30 days. Please enjoy.
