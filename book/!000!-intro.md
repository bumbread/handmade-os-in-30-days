## Preface

Welcome abroad, young OS developer! You have stepped out into an endless ocean of the one of the most interesting hobbies there are. Trust me, this book barely scratches the surface of what's possible, but it gives enough for you to build something you can show off to your friends and if you want, learn more about OS development, giving you not only the opportunity to build **an** OS, but the opportunity to build you **the** OS you want.

Each chapter is named according to what you're about to do in the chapter, but besides the instruction, each chapter contains the detailed explanation of what we're doing and why we're doing. If you're blindly copying the code, don't expect it to work! Read the book carefully, make sure you understand everything.
