title: 'Handmade OS in 30 days.'
...

## Disclaimer.

This book is inspired by a Japanese book with similar name, that's called "Self-made OS in 30 days". The code and explanations don't change as much, although the structure of the book has changed a bit.

In particular, the original book used to ship all the programs for building the OS. In particular NASK (modified NASM), modified gcc, modified QEMU are shipped together with the CD-ROM of the original book. In this book these tools have to be downloaded according to your operating system. For the instructions see the readme file.

## Preface

"I want to create an OS". Every programmer has had friends that had this dream. Well, "every" is probably an overstatement, but this phrase most likely hits the top 10 programmer's dreams.

You might think that creating an OS is a tremendous task. Most likely this is a conspiracy by the OS development companies :D. In reality OS's are not that hard to create compared to other programs, at least I think so.

There may be readers who tried to make an OS once, and gave up because they thought that it was too difficult. People like this probably won't believe what I say. Most likely, it didn't fail because it was difficult, it failed because there was no one to explain that it was easy.

It doesn't just apply to the OS creation. If your teacher (be it a school teacher or an author of an article on the internet) thinks that something is difficult to understand, then his explanation will also be confusing. You shouldn't expect a simple-to-understand explanation from such people.

Will you take on the challenge of OS creation together with me? If you ever thought about making an OS, I think you will probably enjoy it.

Since the text is too light it's possible that you will read it too swiftly. If you do so, then it won't stay in your head, so try chewing through the text slowly. Since the code is as important as the explanation, read through the code carefully as well.

In this book the OS is written using the C language and an assembly language. But don't worry. You can study these while making the OS. I'm writing carefully. To a degree, where there are people who say things like "I started understanding pointers in C for the first time after reading this book!". So even if you're complete beginner, you'll still make a nice OS in 30 days. Please enjoy.
