## Preface

Making an Operating System has probably crossed the mind of every programmer who is eager to try programming different things and fiddle around with code.

You might think that creating an OS is a very difficult task. Most likely this is a conspiracy devised by the OS development companies, heh. In reality the Operating Systems are not that hard to create, compared to other programs, at least I think so.

There may be readers who tried to make an OS and gave up because it was too difficult. It didn't fail because it was difficult, it failed because there was no one to explain that it was easy.

In general, if your teacher thinks that something difficult to understand, then his explanation will also be confusing. You won't expect a simple-to-understand explanation from such people.

So here I am to prove you that creating an Operating System is actually easy. Would you challenge the OS creation together with me? If you ever thought about making an OS, I think you will probably enjoy it.

Since the text is too light it's possible that you will read it too swiftly. If you do so, then it won't stay in your head, so try chewing through the text slowly. Since the code is as important as the explanation, read through the code carefully as well.

In this book the OS is written using the C language and an assembly language. But don't worry. You can study these while making an OS. I'm writing carefully. To a degree, where there are people who say things like "I started understanding pointers in C for the first time after reading this book!". So even if you start from this point, you'll still make a nice OS in 30 days. Please enjoy.
