Precautions that could not be incorporated into text (I could not edit the
text in time)

*

Every copy of CD-ROM has a read-only attribute attached to it. I completely
forgot about it and forgot to write a note in the text.

TN: Anyway, when copying files from the ISO I had already fixed these issues
by removing the read-only attribute from the files. They should be registered
by git. In the original ISO file this section also contained instructions to
remove the files, which I had removed.

QEMU in ./tolset doesn't seem to work unless it's Windows 2000 or later.
I'm sorry. So when I searched for an older version of QEMU I found one that
works on Windows 95 and above.

TN: I nuked windows 95 support. Idk if doing something as bad as this would
still make me a "translator", but my motivation is not only to translate this
book but to reiterate on it and try making it even simpler to follow. Nuking
the support for the OS that no one uses is enough of internal simplification
in itself.
