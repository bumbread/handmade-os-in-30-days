This is a translation of a japanese book called

  「30日でできる！ OS自作入門」; or
  "Make it in 30 days! Introduction to self-made OS"

The title is a bit lengthy so it was shortened. This book has a few differences
from the original worth talking about beforehead. First, if you are using
Windows XP or earlier you may not be able to follow this tutorial. If you are
using Windows 2000 or earlier you *won't* be able to follow this tutorial, due
to differences in the software that this book provides. The software provided
in this book is partially the software provided by the author and partially
is free open source cross-platform software.

Unlike the original book, this book includes the instruction for linux users
within the text rather than putting it onto the support website. Speaking of
the support website, the start of the book contains the link to the support
website. But since that website is in japanese all the other mentions of it
have been safely removed.

Or create a pull request. How to do this is described below.

Contributing

  All contributions are welcome. In order to submit an error, fork this
  repository to your hard drive. Then navigate to book/ subdirectory and find
  an .md file corresponding to the chapter number. Note that filenames starting
  with "!" do not correspond to chaters of the book, but rather to other
  sections of the book. Edit the markdown file to fix the error, then you will
  have to rebuild the book.html file. When editing .md files make sure to
  enable some kind of wrapping in your text editor. Otherwise you may
  experience difficulty editing the contents of the book. Avoid putting manual
  line breaks.

  For this make sure you've got pandoc installed. If you haven't got pandoc
  installed on your machine follow this URL:

    https://pandoc.org/installing.html

  Now you can build the book into an HTML document. Open your shell and type
  the command described next. Depending on your shell the command will look
  a bit different.

  Windows (cmd.exe):
    build

  Linux (/bin/sh) or Windows (powershell):
    ./build

  Now book.html should be updated. You can open this file in your browser and
  verify that the changes are correct and that there are no errors. After that
  you can commit your changes and create a pull request.

  Please check the following section to better understand the organization of
  the project.

Notes:

  1/ I have tried organizing the project in a way that would work for multiple
  OS but it requires some assumptions, mainly that your OS sorts the folders
  alphabetically. It is important that the sort order in book/ folder is
  alphabetical. To check run `ls` (linux) or `dir` (windows) command and check
  whether the order is correct. It should look something like that:

    !000!-start.md
    !001!-preface.md
    !002!-toc.md
    00.md
    01.md
    02.md
    ...
    31.md

  If it does not, after you build the project the resulting HTML will have
  content in the wrong order. Note that different programs have different
  opinion on what constitutes "alphabetical sorting". The exclamation mark
  is a character whose codepoint is less than any other character or digit and
  its positions within filenames makes it so that different sorting algorithm
  no matter what sorts them correctly. If this causes any further issue I
  believe I'll have to write a utility that will concatenate files in the
  correct order.

  2/ When dealing with footnotes note that the footnote number is common for
  every single file in the book/ directory. The structure here is the following.

    file whose name starts with ! don't contain footnotes.
    chapter 0 contains footnote numbers 0..9
    chapter 1 contains footnote numbers 10..19
    chapter 2 contains footnote numbers 20..29
    ...
    chapter 31 contains footnote numbers 30..39

  This means that every chapter is limited to 10 footnotes. This simplifies the
  insertion and removal of footnotes.

  3/ Make sure that every file starts and ends with one or two empty lines.
  This is to make sure that after concatenation different files occupy at least
  different paragraphs.
